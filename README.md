# Jean-Claude Moritz — Community Coding Space

Welcome to my brand‑new GitHub repository!  
This space is the beginning of something simple but meaningful:  
a place where we can **share ideas, explore code, and learn from each other**.

I’m just getting started here, so things will grow over time.  
The goal is to build an open, collaborative corner of the internet where anyone can:

- Share helpful snippets  
- Explore small projects  
- Contribute improvements  
- Ask questions  
- Learn together  

Everything in this repository is meant to be **open, accessible, and free to use**.  
If you find something useful, take it. If you want to improve something, jump in.  
If you have an idea, open an issue or submit a pull request — I’d love to see it.

This is a community space, not a polished product.  
Let’s build it together.

Merci Bien,  
**Jean-Claude Moritz**
